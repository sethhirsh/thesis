A \LaTeX\ template for Senior Comp theses has be created to benefit students
who find the organizational aspects of such a project difficult or unclear.
This paper proposes itself as just such a template.  Using this template as
a reference guide, students should be able to understand the form and function
of the different parts of a formal thesis; they may, of course, choose
to deviate from it as necessary or desirable in the context of their own project
proposals.  This thesis makes use of the {\tt gatorthesis.sty} style-file.
