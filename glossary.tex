\begin{glossary}

  a convenient reference for the reader.

  can be helpful to a reader but is not required.]
  
  \begin{description}
  \item[Displacement Subdivison Surface] (\emph{DS-surface}) Any of a class of
  subdivision-based surfaces which include a boundary displacement field (whether
  a scalar, normal displacement, or a vector-in-frame-based displacement) applied
  to the vertices at any given subdivision level.  The field may be stored on a
  \emph{per vertex} basis or as indexed values in a displacement map.
  \item[Iteratively Interpolating Subdivision Surface] (\emph{IIS-surface}) \ An interpolating
  subdivision surface based on interatively solving for an initializing mesh which will
  intepolate the desired mesh locations.
